        WHY USE ARRAY? Array is index based DS
            Const time access of your data
            Data set is is Limited
            Binary search can be applied to index based DS
        WHY USE LINKED LIST?
            When dunno amount of data
            need to preserve the order of iteration
        WHAT IS BINARY TREE?
            A tree is called binary tree if each node has 0 child , 1 or 2
            Empty Tree -> Single Node -> Valid BT
            Strict BT - Either 2 or no children
            Full BT - If each node has exactly 2 children & all leaf nodes are at a same level
            Height of BT -
                If only root - 0
                Q -> Height = 6
                    then max no. of nodes => 2^(6+1) - 1
            Complete BT - if all leaf nodes are at height h or h-1 & also without any missing number in the sequence
            Transverse -
                InOrder
                PreOrder
                PostOrder
                LevelOrder
            APPLICATIONS OF BINARY TREE:
                * Expression trees are used in compilers
                * Where searching is very frequently
                *

                Tree Searching
                check -
                true? nice
                    chota - left -> check()
                    bada - right -> check()
            Homework -> Use stacks for traversal instead of Linked List
